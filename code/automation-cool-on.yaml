# Home Assistant Automation for turning on HVAC cooling based on thermostat cool switches for upstairs and downstairs zones

# Waits for any ongoing Purge cycle to complete before activating cooling
# Sets the HVAC cycle state to Cool and sets the zone state based on which cool switches are on
# If both zones are set to cool, waits up to 15 minutes for current zone to be turned off before setting zone state to All.
# This was added to reduce energy consumption because running all zones at once took twice as long than cooling both zones individually.
